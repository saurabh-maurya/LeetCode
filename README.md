### 35. SearchInsertPosition
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/ <br>
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found.
If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

### 53. MaximumSubarray
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/ <br>
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

### 217. ContainsDuplicate
https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/ <br>
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

### 278. FirstBadVersion
https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version <br>
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. 
Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. 
Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. 
You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

### 704. BinarySearch
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/ <br>
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
