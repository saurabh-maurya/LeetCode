### 1. TwoSum
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/ <br>
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, 
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, 
and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

### 35. SearchInsertPosition
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/ <br>
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found.
If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

### 53. MaximumSubarray
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/ <br>
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

### 88. MergeSortedArrays
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/ <br>
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

### 189. RotateArray
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/ <br>
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative

### 217. ContainsDuplicate
https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/ <br>
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

### 278. FirstBadVersion
https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version <br>
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. 
Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. 
Since each version is developed based on the previous version, 
all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, 
which causes all the following ones to be bad.
You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. 
Implement a function to find the first bad version. 
You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

### 704. BinarySearch
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/ <br>
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

### 977. SquareOfSortedArray
https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/ <br>
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, 
return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order
