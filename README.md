### 1. TwoSum
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/ <br>
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, 
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, 
and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

### 19. RemoveNthNodeFromList
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/ <br>
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

### 35. SearchInsertPosition
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/ <br>
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found.
If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

### 36. ValidSudoku
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/ <br>
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following

### 53. MaximumSubarray
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/ <br>
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

### 74. Search2DMatrix
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/ <br>
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

### 88. MergeSortedArrays
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/ <br>
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

### 118. PascalTriangle
https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/ <br>
Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

### 121. BestTimeToBuySellStock
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/ <br>
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

### 167. TwoSum_2
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/ <br>
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= first < second <= numbers.length.
Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

### 189. RotateArray
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/ <br>
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative

### 217. ContainsDuplicate
https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/ <br>
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

### 278. FirstBadVersion
https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version <br>
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. 
Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. 
Since each version is developed based on the previous version, 
all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, 
which causes all the following ones to be bad.
You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. 
Implement a function to find the first bad version. 
You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

### 283. MoveZeroes
https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/ <br>
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

### 344. ReverseString
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/ <br>
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
### 350. ArrayIntersection_2
https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/ <br>
Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays, and you may return the result in any order.

### 557. Reverse Words in a String III
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-iii/ <br>
Given a string s, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

### 566. ReshapeMatrix
https://leetcode.com/problems/reshape-the-matrix/ <br>
In MATLAB, there is a handy function called reshape which can reshape an m x n matrix into a new one with a different size r x c keeping its original data.
You are given an m x n matrix mat and two integers r and c representing the number of rows and the number of columns of the wanted to be reshaped matrix.
The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.
If the reshape operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix

### 704. BinarySearch
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/ <br>
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

### 876. MiddleOfList
https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/ <br>
Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

### 977. SquareOfSortedArray
https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/ <br>
